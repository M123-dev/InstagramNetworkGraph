## Getting Started

This project runs on Node.js and does the scraping via a headless chromium instance. It's tested with Node v18.4.0 on Windows 10 & 11.

### Install Node

* [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Install dependencies

``` bash
npm install
```

### Run the project

``` bash
npm run start
```

After that you will be presented a GUI on [localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/config) for configuration.

## Stack

* Puppeteer is used for scraping
* Express.js for config and page hosting
* d3.js for graph generation

## FAQ

* Why not use a pre made plugin for scraping?
  * Normally, Instagram only provides a list of ~20 people you are following, and you have to do a follow-up request for getting the next 20. This is of course not viable for scraping more than a thousand accounts. My workaround for this, a little (probably) bug in the Instagram private API isn't supported by any plugin I could find, so I decided on doing it like this.
